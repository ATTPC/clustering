# Hierarchical Clustering for the AT-TPC

This repository contains hierarchical clustering code for finding particle tracks in the AT-TPC. 

## Authors

The algorithm used in this library was developed by Lukas Aymans as part of his master's thesis in the 
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the 
[Hochschule Niederrhein](https://www.hs-niederrhein.de/home-en/). Questions about the algorithm should
be directed to him.
